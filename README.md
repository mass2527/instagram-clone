### Detail

### What did i learn from this project?

1. learned importance of organized folder structure, clear variable name.

   - As the size of app grows, rewriting code is imperative since i need to fix my code whenever i found a bug.  
     In this kind of moment, organized folder structure and clear variable name make me easily find the file.

2. learned importance of code refactoring.

   - Found out my brain works better when i am watcing clean code.  
     However, when i was trying to write some code on messy code, my brain was fried and don't want to think anymore.  
     Since then, i did code refactoring as much as i can.

3. learned importance of DB structure.

   - As i need to store lots of data like message, user and post, it was really important to have well organized DB strutures so that i can easily read, update or delete it.

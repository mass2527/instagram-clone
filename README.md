### **What did i learn**

`1. learned importance of organized folder structure, clear variable name.`

As the size of app grows, rewriting code is imperative since i need to fix my code whenever i found a bug.  
 In this kind of moment, organized folder structure and clear variable name make me easily find the file.

`2. learned importance of code refactoring.`

Found out my brain works better when i am watcing clean code.  
 However, when i was trying to write some code on messy code, my brain was fried and don't want to think anymore.  
 Since then, i did code refactoring as much as i can.

`3. learned importance of DB structure.`

As i need to store lots of data like message, user and post, it was really important to have well organized DB strutures so that i can easily read, update or delete it.
